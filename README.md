# Kubernetes-Security-Scan

This repository contains the results of a Kubernetes security scan using [Kubescape](https://github.com/armosec/kubescape) or another security tool. The scan was performed on a local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, K3s, or Kind), and the findings have been exported as a JSON file.

## Background

Kubernetes clusters can be vulnerable to various security risks, and it is essential to run security scans regularly to ensure the cluster is secure. This repository provides the results of a security scan, which includes details about potential security issues and vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes configuration.

## Tools Used

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Local installation using Minikube/K3s/Kind
- **Security Tool**: Kubescape (or other tools)
- **Scan Output Format**: JSON

## Files

- `findings.json`: This file contains the security findings from the Kubernetes security scan. It includes details such as the severity of the issues and descriptions of the vulnerabilities detected.

## Usage

1. **Set up a Local Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Install a local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, K3s, Kind, etc.) on your machine.
   - Follow the respective installation guides for the tool you choose.

2. **Install Kubescape**:
   - Install [Kubescape](https://github.com/armosec/kubescape) or another Kubernetes security scanning tool.
   - Follow the installation instructions on the official website.

3. **Run the Security Scan**:
   - Run the scan on your Kubernetes cluster using the command:
     ```bash
     kubescape scan --scope cluster
     ```
   - Replace `--scope cluster` with the appropriate flags for your environment and configuration.

4. **Check the Results**:
   - After the scan, the findings will be saved in a JSON file (`results.json`).
   - This file is included in the repository for reference.
